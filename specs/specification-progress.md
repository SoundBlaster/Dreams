# Dreams specification progress

Goal: maintain compact architecture maps and consumer contracts alongside code
changes. Initial scope: repository maintenance rules and the browser glyph
editor on `96fef7ad121cf9ba278eabd878c5179fd754a0cd`. All recovered contracts are **descriptive drafts**;
formal acceptance and runtime conformance remain separate owner decisions.

## Coverage — 2026-10-13

| HC role/path | Consumer / profile | Contract or disposition | Baseline / evidence | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dreams | Contributors | Coarse orientation only | application.hc/hcs; source orientation | Expand by consumer need |
| DesktopApplication | macOS user / overlay, transparent, multi-display | Unexplored | Entry-point orientation, no recovered contract | Next pilot: overlay lifecycle and safe exit |
| AgentIntegrations | Codex/Claude hooks and MCP | Unexplored | Package/plugin entrypoints only | Recover event/privacy/lifecycle obligations |
| GlyphToolchain.FontBuild | Font contributor / release | Unexplored | pipeline.py orientation only | Recover adoption/build/install boundary |
| GlyphEditor | Glyph contributor / local-server and standalone | dreams.glyph.editor | Pinned source + source review; structural results linked below | Review parent obligations and async saves |
| GlyphEditor.EditingSession | Contributor | Folded into editor | edit/restore/endDrag | Review browser/gesture scenarios |
| GlyphEditor.Geometry | UI, Node validator, SVG consumer | dreams.glyph.geometry | Pinned model | Review coordinates and metric compatibility |
| GlyphEditor.SharedStrokes | Contributor, multiple glyphs | dreams.glyph.components | Pinned editor/model | Review clipboard identity and shared-edit scope |
| GlyphEditor.VisualGuides | Contributor | Folded into editor | References, rulers, presets, trace | Browser-local recovery and portability remain limited |
| GlyphEditor.ProjectTransfer | JSON/SVG consumer | Folded into editor | loadProject/save/export | Browser receipt is not saved-file evidence |
| GlyphEditor.CheckpointLibrary | Editor tab / local disk | dreams.glyph.checkpoints | Pinned Python/Node adapter | Review concurrency/crash limits |
| GlyphEditor.EditorBuild | Developer | Folded into editor | build + pipeline.toml | No font adoption claim |
| tvOS / clock | Apple TV user | Deferred, separate branch PR #8 | Not analyzed in this checkout | Recover after integration on its own baseline |

Maps: [architecture index](hypercode/README.md). Contracts, claim origins,
source bindings, scenarios and unresolved decisions:
[glyph editor](glyph-editor/README.md), [matrix](glyph-editor/matrix.md).
Validation: [2026-10-13](glyph-editor/validation/2026-10-13/README.md).

## Maintenance cycle

Before implementation, identify affected roles, profiles and stable claim IDs.
After implementation, update current contracts/bindings and add a new evidence
baseline. For a change preserving a contract, record its IDs and justification
here rather than rewriting unchanged requirements. Preserve old records as
historical; a successful old run cannot prove a new source revision.

Initial recovery is documentation/tooling only: no application/editor behavior,
user glyph/checkpoint database, font resources or acceptance state changed.
Previous local test/browser observations from the editor development remain
historical; this recovery does not relabel them as fresh execution evidence.
